## Job Interview SQL Query Question ##
1. You are an ecommerce company that sells products
2. There is a SQL table containing the following columns:
..* user_id (INT)
..* order_id (INT)
..* order_date (TEXT in the format YYYY-MM-DD and ignoring hours, minutes, and seconds for the sake of this problem)
3. The CEO just asked: "What is the average time between orders across all customers"?

What's your query, yo?
